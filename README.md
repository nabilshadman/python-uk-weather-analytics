Analysis of UK Weather and Weather’s Impact on Happiness

Abstract - In this paper, I analyse weather data of the United Kingdom using both unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms. Due to the natural variation of weather observed by the UK’s weather stations at the tails of their distributions, some clusters of stations are identified. The variation of weather observed regionally enables the building of classification models to predict the region of a station with decent accuracies. Also, I investigate whether the weather in the UK has a linear relationship with happiness in the UK. The analysis demonstrates that the weather in the UK has a negligible effect on happiness in the UK. The entire workflow of this analysis is automated using Python and Bash, and the code and the data are made available for anyone interested in expanding on this work.
